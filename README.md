# Fake-News-Detection-
This project uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify news articles as real or fake. It leverages text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and machine learning models like Logistic Regression or Naive Bayes to detect misinformation. Future improvements include deep learning models and real-time deployment.
